Message of the day.

## How to create a message of the day

In your page metadata, create a message for each weekday (motd1 to motd7), and put a `[motd]` shortcut where the message should be displayed. 

## Examples

Here is an example content file. 

````
---
Title: Page title
motd1: Today is monday
motd2: Tuesday, the week is still way to long
Motd3: Wednesday, theres light on the horizon!
motd4: Thursday, also called the little friday
Motd5: Friday, the weekend is finally here!
Motd6: What are your plans for saturday night?
motd7: Sunday, lazy sunday
---
Page text goes here as usual.
